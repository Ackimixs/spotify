- add the shufffle and repeat button, i thinks they are easy to implement

- update the volume bar and button

- update the login page

- looking if making the audio as a store is better ? https://github.com/John-Weeks-Dev/spotify-clone/blob/master/src/stores/song.js

BUG :

- When there so much artists there is no overflow and bug with ','

- use vmodel for input

- use onbeforemount ?

- adjust the size of the song list on the ablbum page due to actually it's a fixed height so only work on pc

- autopause : when it reach the end of the song the event pause is triggered but when i click on my buds to pause the song it trigger the same event ? maybe change the config of the audio tag

- tailwind code is completly ugly
